* Check that the power supply is turned off.

* Take the chip from the untested chip box and put it in the socket,
  but do not close it.

* Identify the chip ID (number visible on top of the chip ) 

* Fill the chip ID in labeview & e-traveler.

* Re-check the chip ID from what labeview show on screen and what you
  see in the socket.

* Close the socket.

* Start the automated test of chip n. This will run for 10-15 minutes 
  (As this test runs the operator may have time to finalize the
  archiving and indexing of the chip n-1 test results.)

* test results will be in the form of files : 
  * raw data file & results file : all the data associated to a given
    chip are written in an unique directory with a name based on the
    chip ID .

* Key numbers associated to each chip could be archived in a LSST db :
  there is a few 100 key numbers for each chips ( 8x8 xtalk matrix ,
  noise and gain in # configuration for each of the 8 channels , a few
  linearity curves) : this is an issue the characteristic of each chip
  is not 1 or 10 numbers … its much more . So no way to copy this by
  hand , should be filled automatically.

So the question is what should we do from e-traveler point of view of
the produced files ? To index them will be good …but indeed to read
automatically the « results files « and fill a DB could be nice .
     
* data transfer to archive (we have a directory tree for this at
  ccin2p3 ) : how this is triggered may evolve . It is not excluded
  that we run extra process under linux there ( all the results quoted
  above are produced from window under labview ) , to further analyse
  the file … but I think that Claire try to get right now all the key
  results out of a on the fly labview analysis .  At this stage we may
  forget the linux processing , as this may evolve between now and the
  production …
  
* The idea is that as soon the test is over, if labeview is not
  flashing red and say that the chip can be withdrawn , we can
  withdraw the chip from the socket , put it in the " tested box « and
  move to the test of the chip n+1 … and as I said , as the test of
  the chip n+1 runs , the operator could finalize the writing
  associated to the chip n / look in detail the results its
  characterization .  We will probably not declare at this stage a
  chip okay : we may review all the chips results , and then identify
  / validate the good one . But at least the operator could validate
  that the characterization of the chip n run correctly .

Yes, we did talk together  . 
Still what we could do with the system is quite unclear to us right now , in particular with respect of 
the result of the chip test steps/files & results produced  and how much should be done by hands / how much could be fully automated :
In short a chip test will be ( Claire will probably correct some points , but at this stage this is to give you an idea )  :

   -  Take the chip from the untested  chip box  and put it in the socket (don’t close it ) 

   -  identify the chip ID (number visible on top of the chip ) / fill the chip ID in labeview ( & e-traveler ? ) 

   -  re-check the chip ID  from what labeview show on screen and what you see in the socket . Close the socket

   -  start the automated test  of chip n : will run for 10-15 minutes …as this test runs the operator may have time to finalize the archiving and indexing of the chip n-1 test results 

   -  test results will be in the form of files : 
          - raw data file & results file  :   all the data associated to a given chip are written in an unique  directory with a name based on the chip ID .

   -  Key numbers associated to each chip could be archived in a LSST db :  there is a few  100 key numbers for each chips   ( 8x8 xtalk matrix , noise and gain in # configuration for each of the 8 
       channels , a few linearity curves)   : this is an issue the characteristic of each chip is not 1 or 10 numbers … its much more . So no way to copy this by hand , should be filled automatically. 

So the question is what should we do from e-traveler point of view of the produced files ? To index them will be good …but indeed to read automatically the « results files  «  and fill 
a DB could be nice . 
     
   -  data transfer to archive  (we have a directory tree for this at ccin2p3 ) : how this is triggered may evolve  . It is not excluded that we run extra process under linux there ( all the results quoted
      above are produced from window under labview ) , to further analyse the file … but I think that Claire try to get right now all the key results out of a on the fly  labview analysis .

No problem I could log :-) 
( done from home … )
