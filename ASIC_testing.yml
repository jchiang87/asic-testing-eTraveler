Name: ASIC_testing
HardwareType: ASIC
Description: Chip testing procedure at Paris
Sequence:
  -
   Name: Check power supply
   Description: Ensure the power supply is turned off.
  -
   Name: Place chip in socket
   Description: Take the chip from the untested box and put it in the 
               socket, but do not close the socket.
  -
   Name: Verify the chip ID
   Description: Ensure that the chip ID matches the eTraveler field
               and enter the chip ID into LabView.
  -
   Name: Close the socket
   Description: Close the socket cover.
  -
   Name: Start automated tests
   Description: Start the LabView test script, which will run for
               10-15 minutes.  These tests may fail, in which case,
               LabView will flash a red failure message.
   Selection:
    -
     Condition: PASS
     Name: LabView finishes successfully
     Sequence:
      -
       Name: Save_ASIC_test_results
       Description: LabView tests have finished to completion.  Execute
                   the Job Harness script that persists the output files
                   from the LabView tests.
      -
       Name: Put chip in tested box
       Description: Ensure LabView says the chip can be withdrawn. Remove
                   the chip and place it in the tested box.  Turn off
                   power-supply for next chip (should this be done before
                   removing the chip?).
    -
     Condition: FAIL
     Name: LabView tests do not finish successfully
     Sequence:
      -
       Name: Put chip in failed box
       Description: Ensure LabView says the chip can be withdrawn. Remove
                   the chip and place it in the failed box.  Turn off
                   power-supply for next chip (should this be done before
                   removing the chip?).
